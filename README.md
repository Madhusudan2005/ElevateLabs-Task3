# Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

[cite_start]This project builds a model to predict house prices and was completed for the Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship[cite: 1, 3].

### What I Did:

* **Preprocessed the Data:** Cleaned the dataset and converted categorical string values (like 'yes'/'no') into a numerical format the model can understand.
* **Built the Model:** Implemented a multiple linear regression model using Scikit-learn to find the relationship between house features and price.
* [cite_start]**Evaluated Performance:** Assessed the model's accuracy on a test set using key metrics like MAE, MSE, and the RÂ² score[cite: 11].

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
